**AirBnB clone - The console. **
A team project done by Harriet and Stacy.


**Description of the project**

This is the first step in creating an airbnb clone.
Here is what is handled:

~The parent class handling initialization, serialization and deserialization (BaseModel)

~Creation of a simple flow serialization/deserialization

~Creation  of all classes of the AirBnB that inherit from BaseModel

~Creation of the first abstracted storage machine

~Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


**Description of the command interpreter:**

~Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)/n
~Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…/n
~Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)/n
~Update attributes of an object/n
~Destroy an object/n

We will also  implement the cmd module and the readline library
