**AirBnB clone - The console. **

A team project done by Harriet and Stacy.


**Description of the project**

This is the first step in creating an airbnb clone.

Here is what is handled:

~The parent class handling initialization, serialization and deserialization (BaseModel)

~Creation of a simple flow serialization/deserialization

~Creation  of all classes of the AirBnB that inherit from BaseModel

~Creation of the first abstracted storage machine

~Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


**Description of the command interpreter:**

~Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

~Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

~Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

~Update attributes of an object

~Destroy an object

We will also  implement the cmd module that allows us to start the command interpreter by defining the subclass of the cmd and running the script with the python command.
